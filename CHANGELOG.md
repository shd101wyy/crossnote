## [0.8.19] - 2023-10-06

### Changes

- Deprecated the `processWikiLink` in `parser.js`. Now `crossnote` handles how we process the wiki link.  
  We also added two more options:
  - `wikiLinkTargetFileExtension`: The file extension of the target file. Default is `md`. For example:
    - `[[test]]` will be transformed to `[test](test.md)`
    - `[[test.md]]` will be transformed to `[test](test.md)`
    - `[[test.pdf]]` will be transformed to `[test](test.pdf)` because it has a file extension.
  - `wikiLinkTargetFileNameChangeCase`: How we transform the file name. Default is `none` so we won't change the file name.  
    A list of available options can be found at: https://shd101wyy.github.io/crossnote/interfaces/NotebookConfig.html#wikiLinkTargetFileNameChangeCase

### Bug fixes

- Reverted the markdown transformer and deleted the logic of inserting anchor elements as it's causing a lot of problems.  
  The in-preview editor is not working as expected. So we now hide its highlight lines and elements feature if the markdown file failed to generate the correct source map.

## [0.8.18] - 2023-10-05

## [0.8.17] - 2023-10-04

### New features

  This feature is currently in beta.  
  When the editor is open, you can press `ctrl+s` or `cmd+s` to save the markdown file. You can also press `esc` to close the editor.
- Deprecated the VS Code setting `markdown-preview-enhanced.singlePreview`.  
  Now replaced by `markdown-preview-enhanced.previewMode`:
  - **Single Preview** (_default_)  
    Only one preview will be shown for all editors.
  - **Multiple Previews**  
    Multiple previews will be shown. Each editor has its own preview.
  - **Previews Only** üÜï  
    No editor will be shown. Only previews will be shown. You can use the in-preview editor to edit the markdown.
- Supported to set attribute to image and link, e.g.:

  ```markdown
  ![](path/to/image.png){width=100 height=100}
