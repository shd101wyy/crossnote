### New features

- 📝 Supported in-preview editor that allows you to edit the markdown file directly in the preview 🎉.  
  This feature is currently in beta.  
  When the editor is open, you can press `ctrl+s` or `cmd+s` to save the markdown file. You can also press `esc` to close the editor.

    Only one preview will be shown for all editors.
  - **Multiple Previews**  
    Multiple previews will be shown. Each editor has its own preview.
  - **Previews Only** 🆕  
    No editor will be shown. Only previews will be shown. You can use the in-preview editor to edit the markdown.
- Supported to set attribute to image and link, e.g.:

  ```markdown
  ![](path/to/image.png){width=100 height=100}
  ```

- Improved the markdown transformer to better insert anchors for scroll sync and highlight lines and elements.  
  Added more tests for the markdown transformer to make sure it works as expected.
